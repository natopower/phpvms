## Disposable Theme v2 (phpVms v7)

This theme uses Bootstrap v4.6, Fontawesome v5+ icons to enhance the look of your phpvms installation. It is multi-language ready and designed to be compatible with my current and possible future modules.  
Template is compatible with latest dev build as of date 30.APR.21 and i will try to keep it updated as the development continues.

**Installation**

Same folder structure is used with phpvms v7, so if you have a default installation for it, then installing the themes will take only seconds.  
Just extract the zip file at the root folder of your phpvms v7 installation, and select the templates from admin section.

**Non Standard / Manual Installation**

If you want to manually upload the files or have a modified installtion of phpvms please follow the instructions below;
* Contents of public\image should be placed in your phpvms public folder.(it may be public_html according to your install)
* Contents of public\disposable should be placed in your phpvms public folder.(it may be public_html according to your install)

If you do not have an image (and disposable) folder directly under your public access folder then you may need to create them.
* Contents of public\assets\frontend\css folder should be placed in your phpvms public\assets\frontend\css folder.
* Contents of public\assets\frontend\js folder should be placed in your phpvms public\assets\frontend\js folder.

This is where the default stylesheet files are already placed, so you should be able to find them without any problems.
But if you miss or skip this step, template will really look terrible and you would spot the problem in seconds.

* Contents of resources\lang\en folder should be placed under your phpvms resources\lang\en folder.
* Contents of resources\views\layouts folder should be placed under your phpvms resources\views\layouts folder.

*Important Note: Last value of the theme.json file DOES NOT NEED a comma at the end, all others must have a comma.*  
*It is not a typo or an error in the file, it is how it should be*

**Re-Styling the Theme**

First of all to ease updating process and keeping a working original copy, please DUPLICATE THE THEME and make your own edits there. This includes css duplicating. With this simple procedures you will be able to fully customize your copy and still have the original theme as a backup, so if something goes wrong you can always switch to Disposable v2 defaults and check (same applies to Default theme, never work on default files)

I tried to follow a standard on all blade files, for example all page headings use the same class (card-title) and they are all in `<h3></h3>` tags.  
All card headers are in `<h5></h5>` tags, no manual `style="..."` codes used in the blades except when it is/was really necessary etc.

If you want to change all page title's color you can add below line to the css file instead of editing dozens of blade files one by one.

`.card-title { color: pink; }` or `.card-title { font-size: 150%; color: #FFFFFF; }`

Also i tried to make the css file simple for user to edit, just the top part of the css would be enough for basic style changes. Of course you can do whatever you want in the blade files or in the css but if you are not experienced in things I kindly suggest to always have backups ;)

**IVAO and VATSIM profile links**

If you want the links to be functional please add two profile fields (check admin->users->profile fields) as below;

* name        : IVAO (this field is checked for the correct url)
* description : Ivao ID or IVAO ID (this field is displayed in the blade with the value, can be anything you wish)

* name        : VATSIM (this field is checked for the correct url)
* description : Vatsim ID or VATSIM ID (this field is displayed in the blade with the value, can be anything you wish)

Do not use any spaces in the name field while creating the profile fields, that will generate an error both during display and during user registration.  
If you already defined your profile fields, you can change their names from the admin panel or just change the profile\index.blade to reflect your settings.  

**vmsAcars Users and Extended Stats (needs Disposable Tools & Widgets module)**

User profile will give you simple stats for pilots but if you are using vmsAcars as your flight tracking software, template will dedect it and enable more stats at profile page. Some directly visible some are visible with a click.

**Flights Page/View**

All the details of your flights are by default collapsed, just click the show/hide details icon to see full basic details of flights (like route, subfleets, notes)

**Footer Positioning and Content**

If you want to have a larger footer (like 2-3 lines or images/links etc), then you need to edit the css file to give it more space 'cause to keep it really where it belongs (at the bottom of the page) I had to use some definitions for it.  
To do this, head to the css file and go to end directly, you will find the definitions and simple explanations for footer there.

**Diffences Compared to v1 series**

* Multi-language/translation support (only English provided by default)
* Configuration via theme.json file
* Ready for Disposable Modules

**Tests**

The main theme was tested with Chrome,Firefox,Safari,Opera and Ms Edge on desktop computers. Also some tests done with mobile phones and tablets.  
If you encounter problems in a specific device just let me know, maybe we can fix it.

Safe flights and enjoy,
